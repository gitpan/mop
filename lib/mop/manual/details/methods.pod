=head1 GRAMMAR

Method in the p5-mop are defined in the following way:

  method NAME
    ?( '(' VARIABLE ?(= EXPR) ?(, VARIABLE ?(= EXPR))* ')' )
    ?(is TRAIT ?(, TRAIT)*)
  BLOCK

The C<method> keyword is followed by name.

Which is optionally followed by a list of method parameters
wrapped in parentheses. Method parameters are simple variables
optionally followed by the assignment operator (C<=>) which
is then followed by a perl expression.

Which is optionally followed by the C<is> keyword that is
followed by a comma separated list of traits you wish to
be applied to your method.

After this comes a block, within which you can define
the body of the method.
