=head1 GRAMMAR

Classes in the p5-mop are defined in the following way:

  class NAME
    ?(extends NAME)
    ?(with NAME ?(, NAME)*)
    ?(meta NAME)
    ?(is TRAIT ?(, TRAIT)*)
  BLOCK

The C<class> keyword is followed by a name.

Which is optionally followed by the C<extends> keyword
that is followed by the name of the class you wish to
subclass.

Which is optionally followed by the C<with> keyword that is
followed by a comma separated list of the names of the roles
you wish to be composed into your class.

Which is optionally followed by the C<meta> keyword
that is followed by the name of the metaclass you wish to
be used in constructing this class.

Which is optionally followed by the C<is> keyword that is
followed by a comma separated list of traits you wish to
be applied to your class.

After this comes a block, within which you can define
methods and attributes (refer to those docs for more info).
